# Front End Development with Vue.js - IT Academy

## **Sprint 4 - Video Management Tool**

This sprint focuses on the core concepts of ECMASCript 6, or ES6 for short. Below is the project brief:

> A company in the audiovisual sector has asked us for a web application that will allow their employees to quickly find movies from a large database they have, since the process is currently done manually.
>
> You will be in charge of setting up the core of the application: all the logic of filtering and sorting of movies. You have 2 weeks to finish, which is how long this sprint lasts.

Also, this sprint introduces unit testing. The tests are already written for me in `film.specs.js` and I have to make sure my code passes them.
